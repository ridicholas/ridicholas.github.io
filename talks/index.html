They are used not only to flag previously fact-checked misinformation, but also to provide suggestions about which trending claims should be prioritized for fact-checking - a paradigm called ‘check-worthiness.’ While several studies have examined the accuracy of these algorithms, none have investigated how the benefits from these algorithms (via reduction in exposure to misinformation) are distributed amongst various online communities. In this paper, we investigate how diverse representation across multiple stages of the AI development pipeline affects the distribution of benefits from AI-assisted fact-checking for different online communities. We simulate information propagation through the network using our novel Topic-Aware, Community-Impacted Twitter (TACIT) simulator on a large Twitter followers network, tuned to produce realistic cascades of true and false information across multiple topics. Finally, using simulated data as a test bed, we implement numerous algorithmic fact-checking interventions that explicitly account for notions of diversity. We find that both representative and egalitarian methods for sampling and labeling check-worthiness model training data can lead to network-wide benefit concentrated in majority communities, while incorporating diversity into how fact-checkers use algorithmic recommendations can actively reduce inequalities in benefits between majority and minority communities. These findings contribute to an important conversation around the responsible implementation of AI-assisted fact-checking by social media platforms and fact-checking organizations.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Neumann, Terrence and Wolczynski, Nicholas}, year={2023}, pages={480–490}, collection={FAccT ’23} }</span></li>

High-Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) is an alarmin that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple liver diseases. Its use as a biomarker for liver disease in those with AUD has not been studied. In this report, we investigated the association between serum HMGB1 and the presence, severity, and progression of ALD in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with AUD. In our discovery cohort of 80 patients, we found that patients with AUD and ALD exhibited higher serum HMGB1 levels compared to patients with AUD only (p = 0.0002). Additionally, serum HMGB1 levels were positively associated with liver disease severity (p &lt; 0.0001). We found that index serum HMGB1 levels were associated with liver disease progression, defined by an increase in MELD score at 120 days (p = 0.0397). Serum HMGB1 was notable for its diagnostic and prognostic ability; it proved able to distinguish accurately between severe and non-severe forms of ALD in both our discovery cohort (AUC = 0.8199, p = 0.0003) and an independent validation cohort of 74 patients with AUD (AUC = 0.8818, p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, serum HMGB1 levels effectively predicted both liver-related readmission (AUC = 0.8849, p &lt; 0.0001) and transplantation/death (AUC = 0.8614, p = 0.0002) at 90 days. The predictive potential of HMGB1 was also validated in an independent cohort of patients with AUD. Taken together, our results suggest that serum HMGB1 shows promise as a biologically relevant biomarker for ALD in patients with AUD.}, journal={Alcohol}, author={Vannier, Augustin G.L. and Wardwell, Ben and Fomin, Vladislav and PeBenito, Amanda and Wolczynski, Nicholas and Piaker, Samuel and Kedrin, Dmitriy and Chung, Raymond T. and Schaefer, Esperance and Goodman, Russell and et al.}, year={2021}, pages={37–43} }</span></li>

}, DOI={10.1287/isre.2022.0305}, abstractNote={ In an era dominated by social media, users are regularly exposed to propaganda, including efforts by authoritarian countries to undermine trust in government and health officials during elections and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Facebook and Twitter have taken steps to address this issue by adding labels indicating state-controlled media from certain countries like Russia, China, and Iran. This article investigates the effectiveness of state-controlled media labels in countering propaganda on social media, with a focus on Facebook. The researchers conduct two controlled online experiments and analyze field data surrounding Facebook’s policy change in June 2020. The results indicate that state-controlled media labels can be effective in reducing engagement. However, the efficacy of the labels depends on users actively noticing them and the sentiment toward the country indicated in the label. Labels for countries with negative public sentiment showed a significant decrease in engagement, while those for positively perceived countries did not have the same impact. The study suggests that social media platforms should inform users about labeling policies and display labels prominently. Although propaganda will likely remain on social media, efforts to reduce its spread can be effective with proper implementation and awareness. }, number={0}, journal={Information Systems Research}, author={Moravec, Patricia L. and Collis, Avinash and Wolczynski, Nicholas}, year={0AD}, pages={null} }</span></li></ol>
